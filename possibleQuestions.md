Desperate people take personality tests to gain self-understanding and improve themselves. They can provide validation and identify patterns in thoughts and behaviors. You should definetly find out who you are from Istoria Igrushek.

## mbti tests
As i said, taking personality tests periodically changes your life quality. But taking tests for each movie or cartoon takes time. Fortunately our smart people around the world know the lifehack. </br>
The first thing you want to do is to take a MBTI test, which tells your personality type. then you compare that personality type to  your favorite character's type. I got the same thing as Simon from Alvin and the Chipmunks. Happy!

That mbti test is usually taken [HERE](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) 

And my personal opinion about this test is pizdec kakoy negativeni. The questions are generic, sometimes impossible to answer without double-thinking. I think this type of tests should be easy to answer ever if you have multiple personalities. I swear, every personality i have **love Adventure Time.** 

So here comes a better test, that contains better questions. (Chosen by me and our second [glavni guy](https://github.com/antaranyan/) here, that my personalities take into consideration. da.)

Thank you.
